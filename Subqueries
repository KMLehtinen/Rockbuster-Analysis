FROM customer
INNER JOIN payment ON customer.customer_id=payment.customer_id
INNER JOIN address ON customer.address_id=address_id
INNER JOIN city ON address.city_id=city.city_id
INNER JOIN country ON city.country_id=country.country_id
GROUP BY first_name, last_name, city, customer.customer_id, country
HAVING city IN ('Aurora', 'Acua', 'Citrus Heights', 'Iwaki', 'Ambattur', 'Shanwei')
ORDER BY "Total amount paid" DESC
LIMIT 5) AS total_amount_paid
